> "The Lord made him master of his own house."

--- from Lauds today, Feast of Saint Joseph, spouse of Holy Mary

Oh! How we need burly, holy men who humble strive to answer God's call to lead their families boldly toward holiness! Who better to turn to in our poverty of masculinity that the man God chose to be under as he grew in wisdom and stature (Luke 2:40).

## Neither Macho nor Feckless

Manly husbands and fathers are neither macho --- a form of arrogant pride easily threatened by other's success, nor castrated --- an abdication of responsibility to God's Truth, a form of sloth which fecklessly supports all endeavors irrespective of holiness).

## Righteous, Humble, and Obedient to God's Truth

God calls every man to be righteous and humble, obedient to God's Truth and Love.

## Father for Women and for Men

Petition and allow Holy Papa Joseph to father you into who God created you to be.

If you are a woman, ask him to father you, to teach you the womanly art of humble service, obedience, in the quest to bear new life into the world.

If you are a man, ask him to father you in learning how to be obedient to God's Truth and Love while seeking righteousness and humbly serving as master of your house --- holding yourself more accountable to God than any others in your care.

## Make Satan Quake

Such women and men makes Satan quake. Be of strong heart and will and courageously reveal to the world that being a humble man or woman of faith shines the light of Christ into the darkness of the world. Let Holy Papa Joseph humbly polish your lamp glass clear and fill with finest oil your lantern, that the spark of the Holy Spirit may light up the world with the light of Christ through you.
