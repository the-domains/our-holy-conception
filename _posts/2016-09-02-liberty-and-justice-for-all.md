# Liberty and Justice for All

## Video Exploration of Catholic Social Teaching

Words like "common good," "social justice," "freedom," and "human dignity" get tossed about in today's society, but they mean something much more profound and challenging when we look at their deeper Catholic meaning.

In this rapid fire video you'll discover:

* Jesus calls us to be selfish (in an oddly good way) by caring for and serving others...
* What happened at your conception that gives you value, meaning, and purpose beyond price...
* Justice is not about a courtroom, but Right Relationship...
* True freedom unites us with God...
* A three-legged stool falls over when one leg is missing...
* It may be possible that giving someone more money actually undermines human dignity...

In this presidential election year, and with some stunning ballot initiatives on our Colorado ballot, we have a lot to think and pray about before we vote. Enjoy the video, and please feel free to ask my any question it may bring up for you. May God startle you with joy!
