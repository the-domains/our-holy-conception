Seriously. This Advent, consider focusing all story time on reading books with minimal pictures. The difference in your kids will amaze you.

How do we know? We don't have a television. We occasionally stream a carefully chosen movie. Right now, at our six-year-old's request, we are reading the "Lord of the Rings" by J.R.R. Tolkien. She easily handles 20--60 minutes of reading, as does her three-year-old sister. It's the "hundredth" time through it for our two oldest, who started a few years older than six.

And if I may humbly suggest a Christmas story I wrote, with a few pictures, lots of adventure, and a completely new, very old way of understanding Christmas, keep your eye on this space for "Luke and the One Mass", publishing to Amazon's Kindle this Thanksgiving Weekend!
