Eliminate everything that isn't simple. Satan hides in false complexity and genuine complexity is rather intricate in detail but practical application of simple concept and principle. Thus, all complexity hides Satan, who should be rooted out by the upheaval of simplifying the artificially complex.

Eliminate the Complex . What remains matters. What remains is essential. What remains has room and grows, breathes, and ascends to it's proper place. For sin is simply placing the wrong thing ahead of the right thing. A lesser good ahead of a better good. Discover the Best Good through simplicity, by stripping things bare and discovering what is essential.

Seek family simplicity. Allow God to startle you with the joy of less. Among many examples:

* [Sabbath][0]
* [Simple Rosary][1]
* [Shared Meals][2]
* [Silence][3]

May God startle you with joy!
