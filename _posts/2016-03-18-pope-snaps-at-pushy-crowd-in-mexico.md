[Pope snaps at pushy crowd in Mexico][0]

Sin makes us stupid. It can be an act of loving compassion to point out sinful (aka stupid) behavior to those who do it. A great example of this humble service is the above link, describing Pope Francis' chastizing people tugging him toward them so he falls onto a person in a wheelchair.

Another way to understand sin is that it is quite simply putting the wrong thing ahead of the right thing. Getting so caught in the frenzie to touch Pope Francis that a person yanks him into a person in a wheelchair is clearly putting the wrong thing ahead of the right thing. Pope Francis gave a simple, crisp, clear reminder not to be stupid. Nothing odd about that.

What IS odd, is people failing to see Pope Francis' "Don't be selfish!" as humble service to them on their journey through the temptations of sin trying to distract us from running toward Christ (as Saint Benedict puts it). Humble service encouraging someone to exercise their will over their sinner and stop being stupid --- that is a gift I certainly need to hear at times. Thank you, Pope Francis for deftly exercising the Salvation Arts!
