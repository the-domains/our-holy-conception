By Deacon Patrick Augustine Jones

Experience Christmas anew with your family, rediscovering the reason Jesus our Christ was born among us in this marvelous, adventurous Christmas tale. Seven-year-old Luke has just endured days of chaos moving cross country with his family. He shirks responsibility and dashes into the wild winter mountains surrounding their new home, where he becomes injured, lost, and afraid. Desperate, he asks Jesus for help. The form of that help will transform his life, and perhaps even readers' lives, as the timeless truth of Christmas is revealed in a whole new way.

[Available as a Kindle e-book.][0]

She meets her Nanna and discovers the wild adventure that is the One Mass, fleeing from Pharaoh, dancing to the Psalms, sailing with Saint Paul, and witnessing the resurrection of Jesus. You will be forever changed as you learn how each Mass is the One Mass, and it will become a deeper and richer experience for you and your family.
