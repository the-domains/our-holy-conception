# About

## Vision

Our Holy Conception strives to help married couples live marriage as their path to holiness. Toward this end we seek to become a Catholic society of married, religious, and single faithful who serve Christ in the many and various poverties unaddressed in our society, living out a focus that Marriage is a path to holiness and family and economic life are both opportunities to express God's revelation to all peoples.

Our Holy Conception is a ministry of the [Diocese of Colorado Springs][0].

## Deacon Patrick Jones

I am a Roman Catholic deacon serving in the Diocese of Colorado Springs, Colorado. My family and I live on the slope of Pikes Peak.
Married in 1990 after our freshman year in college, my wife and I have long felt the call to create community and help other married couples run to Christ with marriage as their path to holiness.
