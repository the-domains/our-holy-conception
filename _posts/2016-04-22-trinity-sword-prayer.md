# Trinity Sword Prayer

Never entertain sin or thoughts of sin! Upon the first whiff of sin immediately draw the sword and pray:

## Father,

help me see how ridiculous \_\_\_\_\_ (name the temptation) is!

## Jesus,

grant me the humility to accept your gift of the grace of \_\_\_\_\_ _, _which always defeats the temptation of \_\_\_\_\_ .

## Holy Spirit,

guide me to see and then immediately take the one next step to breathe my Breath of God into the world. Specifically, my next step is to \_\_\_\_\_. Give me the fortitude to do it now.

-Amen!
