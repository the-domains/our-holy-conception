# Trinity Sword Prayer

Upon the first whiff of sin immediately draw the sword and pray:

## Father,

help me see how ridiculous \_\_\_\_\_ (name the temptation) is!

## Jesus,

grant me the humility to accept your gift of the grace of \_\_\_\_\_ _, _which always defeats the temptation of \_\_\_\_\_ .

## Holy Spirit,

guide me to see and then immediately take, right after this prayer, the one next step to breathe my Breath of God into the world. Specifically, my next step is to \_\_\_\_\_. Give me the fortitude to go and do it now.

-Amen!
