# Trinity Sword Prayer

Never entertain sin or thoughts of sin! Upon the first whiff of sin immediately draw the sword and pray:

## Father,

help me see how ridiculous \_\_\_\_\_ (name the temptation) is!

## Jesus,

grant me the humility to accept your gift of the grace of \_\_\_\_\_ _, _which always defeats the temptation of \_\_\_\_\_ . 

## Holy Spirit,

guide me to see and immediately take the one next step to breathe my Breath of God into the world. Specifically, my next step is to \_\_\_\_\_. Give me the fortitude to go and do it now.

In the name of the Father, of the Son, and of the Holy Spirit, amen!

## A few notes

## God always answers this prayer.

"If you remain in me and my words remain in you, ask for whatever you want and it will be done for you." (John 15:7).

Asking for the weapons of the [Salvation Arts][0] always remains in God, making His words remain in us. The prayer to the Father asks for the Salvation Art of Mindfulness to see how ridiculous sin is. The prayer to Jesus asks for one of the virtues, another Salvation Art. And the final prayer to the Holy Spirit asks for the gifts needed to breath our inner breath of God into the world.

## The Father's Gift

**Freedom and laughter.** If you don't feel light and free immediately after calling Satan's temptation ridiculous, you didn't name the temptation clearly or specifically enough. Satan fights us in this prayer and does all he can to hide behind rocks on the battlefield that he may attack us with renewed vigor when we arrogantly think we've won. As long as Satan remains hidden behind a rock, we aren't able to accept the gift of wild freedom God the Father always offers us. We have to exercise our will against Satan and name with clarity the temptation --- not the detailed circumstances, but the flavor of the deadly sin.

Thus, "help me see how ridiculous my sin is!" fails because it isn't specific in naming the deadly sin, leaving lots of rocks for Satan to hide behind.

Likewise, "help me see how ridiculous it is when Sam is praised at work and all my hard work, which was hours and hours and which Sam needed to do his work, for which he was praised ... is!" fails because rather than being prayer that simply names the temptation it repeats and deepens the sin itself.

Instead pray: "Father help me see how ridiculous it is when I am jealous of Sam for succeeding!" This removes all hiding places without entering into the turmoil of the sin, inadvertently repeating the sin anew. Instead, it is short, simple, specific and clear.

If you pray to the Father and do not immediately experience the gift of wild, jubilant freedom, you prayed it wrong. Dig deep, examine how to name the specific deadly sin without repeating the sin, and pray it again. Like using any weapon, the more you wield the Trinity Sword Prayer, the more effective you will become! This is spiritual warfare, you are exercising your will to trust God over Satan, to choose your inner Saint over your inner Sinner. Satan attacks where you are weakest, so naming where his attacking frees you to accept God's abundance, and graces (weaponry). Fight to get this prayer right, and you will be stunned by God's loving abundance!

## Jesus' Gift

**Courage.** Being emboldened. Again, if we do not immediately feel emboldened on praying it, we are allowing our Sinner to hide in how we are praying, preventing us from being able to accept the gift Jesus freely offers us. One way this happens is in our asking for something that isn't a grace. If it isn't one of the seven heavenly, life giving virtues, it may not be a grace. As long as what you ask Jesus for is a grace, it will be given and you will feel emboldened.

## The Holy Spirit's Gift

**Action.** If you don't immediately find yourself with your first two gifts (wild abandon and and courageous) doing the next step to breathe your Breath of God into the world, free of the burden of temptation, you prayed it wrong. Take some time to get to know your Breath of God. Understand that it is through everyday ordinary tasks that miraculous things happen to transform the world, to help build God's kingdom here and now. Make your next step simple and specific and something you can do right now. Open the gift of the Holy Spirit by going and doing it, right now!
