Of course big government can be an agent of mercy. God can use evil for good. This is a strong lesson from Genesis 50, where God uses the evil of Joseph's brothers selling him into slavery to save his people from famine. God is perfectly capable of working through faithful people who happen to work in big government. But is government the solution to our pain? Of course not.

There is a striking thing happening with iPhones and the FBI right now. The FBI's iPhone Backdoor demand of Apple simultaneously illustrates government's unquenchable power grabbing gluttony and governments propensity of ineptitude. Here is [Apple's letter][0] on the subject.

Spy thrillers would have us believe that data on phones is at the benevolent government agent's beck and call whenever the situation requires. Reality, it turns out, differs from fiction. The common, everyday iPhone has encryption security our government can't crack. Jack Bauer, you're hosed.

Allow me to take a step back, to the larger points I alluded to up front: Power hungry, inept government. As Catholics, we are called to uphold the dignity of the human person, always and everywhere. Outside of the legal defending of right, rare is the case when the government is required to uphold human dignity, and more rare still are the cases where government is the best answer for how to uphold human dignity. This is true of serving our unborn, marriage, religious freedom, personal information, our poor, and every other right and freedom a human has.

Big government, often in the guise of Catholic social justice, has sold us the lie that we need government to do these things for us. We do not. In fact, the foundational principle of Catholic social teaching, subsidiarity, tells us quite clearly that the government is rarely the answer. True, an action may be appear to be for the common good, and it may be appear to make everyone stronger through solidarity, but if it isn't owned at the most local practicable level then it undermines human dignity and is neither for the common good or creating solidarity. Rare is the government the most local way to accomplish anything.

Which begs the question, who then is the answer to upholding the dignity of our poor, our unborn, and all of us? Me and you. Working together. The answer is really that simple, and that hard. It is the answer Jesus gave us in Matthew 25 when he said, "as you have done for the least of these, so you have done for me." Oddly, there is nothing there about giving to Caesar so he can do our job for us.

Just as governments are inept at technology and hacking, they are inept at the graces required for upholding human dignity, including mercy, generosity, love, personal sacrifice, and much more --- the graces Jesus our Christ gives the faithful members of His Body every day.
